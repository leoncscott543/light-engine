# Fidelity Management System

This directory manages Light Engineâ€™s dynamic fidelity system, allowing real-time scaling of simulation accuracy, visual precision, and computational cost.

## Purpose

Not all use cases require full scientific fidelity. This system enables developers, scientists, and creatives to balance:

- Realism
- Performance
- Resource usage
- Priority-driven optimization

Fidelity can be globally tuned (via slider) or adjusted per entity, region, or simulation system.

## Structure

- `presets/`: Predefined fidelity configurations (e.g., Creative, RealSim, Scientific)
- `dynamic/`: Algorithms and models that adjust fidelity in real time based on performance goals, interaction density, or developer weights

## Future Scope

Dynamic fidelity will eventually integrate AI optimizers and scene-aware heuristics to automatically tune simulation fidelity based on focus, activity, and available compute.
