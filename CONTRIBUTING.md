
# 🤝 CONTRIBUTING.md — Light Engine

Welcome, creator of realities.  
This document outlines how to contribute to the Light Engine project — whether you're a developer, researcher, artist, engineer, or dreamer.

Light Engine is **not just software** — it’s an evolving simulation of light, matter, causality, and energy. We welcome all who want to help shape the next age of simulation truthfully.

## 🔧 What You Can Contribute

### 🧬 Particles
Define new `particle` data types under `1_matter/particles/`.  
Include physical properties like:
- Mass
- Charge
- Heat capacity
- Reflective index
- Energy thresholds

You may use real-world data or propose fictional constructs that behave in physically plausible ways.

---

### 🧱 Materials
Add programmable `materials` as compositions of particles.  
Define:
- Bonding rules
- Thermal expansion
- Refractive and stress responses
- Visual and physical deformation behaviors

See `1_matter/materials/`.

---

### 🌐 Environments
Design physical `environments` composed of:
- Air particles or vacuums
- Gravity and field rules
- Lighting volumes
- Pressure and temperature domains

See `1_matter/environments/`.

---

### 🔁 Interactions
Add logic to `2_interactions/` to define how particles and materials:
- Collide
- Reflect
- React
- Deform
- Absorb or emit energy

---

### ⚖️ Laws of Nature
Enhance or create new physics laws in `0_ordinem/laws/`:
- Newtonian motion
- Thermodynamics
- Photonic behavior
- Material strength models

All laws must remain transparent, modular, and verifiable.

---

### 🧪 Experiments
Use the `4_lab/` folder to:
- Prototype features
- Stress-test new physics
- Visualize material performance
- Try DSL scenarios

Create a folder under `4_lab/experiments/` with a README and a purpose.

### 🧠 AI & Simulation Intelligence
Help train interaction surrogates using ML and GPU acceleration:
- See the roadmap for upcoming surrogate modules
- Train particle-to-particle predictive models
- Develop asset builders that interface with real-time material design

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

We believe:
- In transparency over convenience
- In realism over faking
- That contributors should be empowered, not locked out
- That simulation is a form of truth-telling

If your code or proposal doesn’t make reality clearer, cleaner, or more computable — ask how it might.
