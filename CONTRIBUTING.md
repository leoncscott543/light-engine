# 🤝 Contributing to Light Engine

Welcome, engineer of the cosmos. 🌌  
Light Engine is not just a codebase — it's a metaphysical framework for building the next generation of simulation, design, and digital materiality.

We value transparency, cooperation, clarity, and truth. This guide helps you start contributing to Light Engine as a developer, scientist, designer, or dreamer.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leoncscott543/light-engine.git
cd light-engine
```

### 2. Build It
Make sure you have Rust installed.
```bash
cargo build
```

### 3. Explore
Start in the `4_lab/` directory and run experiments!

---

## 🌱 Ways to Contribute

### 🧬 Define New Particles
Add realistic or fictional particle types in:
```
1_matter/particles/
```
Follow the struct conventions and include relevant metadata such as atomic mass, density, photonic index, etc.

---

### 🧪 Add an Experiment
Create your own test in:
```
4_lab/experiments/
```
Use it to explore particle collisions, material reactions, photon scattering, or even DSL input parsing.

---

### ⚙️ Create or Improve a Law
Submit new calculations or extend laws in:
```
0_ordinem/laws/
```
Example: laws of motion, optics, thermodynamics, quantum approximations.

---

### 📜 Improve Documentation
Enhance or add documentation for:
- Folders (`README.md` in each directory)
- Particle or material formats
- Simulation demos and CLI tools

---

### 🧰 Extend Utility Kits
Add mathematical helpers or simulation tools in:
```
3_kits/
```

---

## 📐 Project Philosophy

All contributors must uphold the foundational values outlined in:

- [`CONSTITUTION.md`](./CONSTITUTION.md)
- [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md)

---

## 🗳️ Governance & Decision-Making

We operate democratically and transparently.

1. Proposals are opened as GitHub Issues.
2. Community members discuss and refine ideas.
3. Votes are held openly.
4. Supermajority wins for major engine-altering changes.

See [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md) for full rules.

---

## 🛡️ Code of Conduct

Be respectful, kind, and constructive.  
We’re building the first true metaphysical engine — and that deserves care and community.

---

## 🧠 Join Us

- Open a PR, issue, or experiment.
- Create a new fictional material or particle.
- Help us define the future of simulation.

Thanks for being part of the Light.
