### ⚛️ A Real-Time Simulation Engine for Full Physical, Photonic, and Material Realism

Light Engine is a provocation. A philosophical leap. A technological experiment born of awe — not just at what can be rendered, but at the very essence of what *should* be simulated.

I'm not very interested in the pursuit of reality immitation. My aim is to *reconstruct* onto a lower dimention.... a computer.

This is not merely a game engine.
light engine is a open-source generative causal rendering + simulation enviornment. Built ENTIRELY on a new dynamic primitive type, a "particle", governed only by the laws of nature.... The fun part is making possible something that 'seems' like a complete work of fiction.

## 🌌 Vision

> “What if reality itself was the engine?”

---

Imagine a simulation where you cannot cheat... where object rendering isn't a polygomal illusion and physics isn't a patched-on approximation. Where a breeze across a surface isn't faked but emerges from pressure gradients and heat differentials. Where a rendered rock object shatters not because it was pre-scripted to, but because its internal material structure, tension, and kinetic energy thresholds were actually exceeded. What if we could make a model of reality that for all tense and purposes, is a 1 to 1 isomorphic clone of nature in a different medium. More on that work "isomorphic" later. 

This is the promise of Light.

light engine hinges on these 4 axiems:
- If a particular solution does not bring humanity peace and joy, then it is a colossal waste of time and resources. 
- Reality is goverened by strict natural order, but human conceptualization + time are the limiting factors in this perception of order. 
- The future of advanced solvers is qubit based logic (quantum), and the future of data processing is at the light speed (photonic). 
- True beauty is the deep integration of nature and mind. In other words, true beauty is not surface-level only.
- Scienticic and engineering simulation should be generalized so that domain specific problem sets can be solved with near-limitless parameters.

## 🔬 Core Principles

### 1. Physical Reality Must Be Simulated, Not Sketched

light engine is committed to building an actual model of reality — from particle dynamics to photon-matter interactions — not the illusion of reality. That means simulating:
- Collisions with momentum transfer
- Photon absorption and refraction 
- Material deformation, heat, and stress
- Spacetime curvature (Relativity)

This isn't a compromise between visual fidelity and computation. This is an entirely new way of thinking about modeling and computational rendering. 

### 2. Particle Is the New Primitive

At the center of Light rests the `particle` — a deeply programmable, extensible, abstract datatype that encapsulates ALL of the nature's known properties:
- Mass, temperature, spin, charge
- Velocity, position, acceleration
- Surface reflectance, chemical state, bonding logic ect.... 

### 3. Light Is a Physical Participant

No shaders. No baked lighting. No approximations.

In Light, photons are `particles` primitives too. They carry energy and a velocity. They obey thermodynamic principles. 

You don’t render shadows — you simulate occlusion.

You don’t fake color — you simulate wavelength absorption and emission.

Light is not a metaphor. It is a key participant in this world. Much more, its the window into this simulated reality for the user. 

### 4. Materials Are Programmable

You can define ice.

You can define molten lava.

You can define a material that does not exist in our universe and see how it behaves.

This is programmable matter, defined not by textures or parameters, but by what particles compose it, how they bind, how they fail under pressure, and how they respond to energy transfer.

However, unlike a typical graphics engine, these assets are not made in blender or defined by a simple ECS type system.... instead, they are synthesized and stored as unique complex structures. 

### 5. Time and Energy Govern All

There is no game loop. There is no artificial tick rate. Time in Light is causal. Physical causality drives change which renders realative time. 

You can simulate seconds. You can simulate centuries.

The same laws apply.

## 🧬 Structure of the Engine

Light Engine is composed of:

- `particles/` – the atomic building blocks
- `materials/` – bonded collections of particles
- `things/` – usable, nameable composites (a bone, a table, a cloud)
- `interactions/` – collisions, deformation, reactions
- `ordinem/` – time, causality, physics, thermodynamics
- `kits/` – utility tools to build, parse, and calculate
- `lab/` – your playground for experiments
- `src/` – the engine bootloader and core API

Each layer builds on the previous. You don’t hardcode an explosion. You construct materials, give them energy, and **watch what happens.**

## 🧠 Philosophy

This is not just a system.

It is a call to return to the foundations. To remember that the natural world is astonishing not because of what it looks like — but because of what it *is*.

And so we model that.

We model it not because we can sell it.

Not because we can game it.

We model it because truth is beautiful.

And because beauty matters.

## ✨ Possibilities

What could you build with Light?

- A planet made of nothing but iron and simulated at full scale
- A microscopic world with molecules dancing in heat
- A light tunnel that scatters photons across translucent skins
- A new material, born from imagination, tested by computation

This is your engine.

It does not limit you to what’s been done before.

It invites you to simulate what’s never existed.

## 🧑‍💻 For Developers

- Everything is modular
- All constants and formulas live in `ordinem/`
- Every particle property can be computed or defined
- Every material is composable
- The rendering engine is the physics engine

You can:
- Train models using AI on billions of interactions
- Build physics approximators for realtime AI-enhanced simulations
- Export physical data and compare to lab datasets

## 🧑‍🔬 For Scientists

- Build accurate scientific models
- Simulate reactions, environments, collisions
- Share and import materials and scenarios via DSL
- Use Light Engine for education, research, discovery

## 🎨 For Artists

- Design visually stunning scenes that obey real physics
- Create fantasy materials that behave *believably*
- Use Light as a canvas of simulation — not just visual effects

## 🛠️ What's Next

- Alpha phase: two material blocks, full interaction, photon tracing

## 🌍 Final Word

Light Engine isn't here to compete with game engines. It isn't here to replace physics libraries.

It’s here to create a new category — a new mental model for computation, creativity, and the cosmos.

If you’ve ever wanted to simulate reality from the inside out —  
If you've ever wondered what a single photon really does —  
If you’ve ever looked at nature and thought, *“I want to build that,”* —  

**Light Engine is for you.**

Welcome to the beginning.

Let there be Light.
