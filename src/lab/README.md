# ðŸ§ª lab/

A sandbox for experiments, tests, and visual proof-of-concepts.  
This is where you **prototype, debug, and push boundaries** without affecting core modules.

### Subfolders:
- `experiments/` â€“ Try wild ideas, visuals, or new interactions
- `unit/` â€“ File-based unit tests
- `systems/` â€“ Large-scale testbeds (e.g., matter + interaction)
- `visualization/` â€“ Particle trails, LOD maps, etc.
- `dev_notes/` â€“ Benchmarks, planning, scratch
