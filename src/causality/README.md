# 🔁 interactions/

The rules of engagement between particles, materials, and light.  
This module encodes **how things behave, collide, bend, reflect, or transform**.

### Modules:
- `photons/` – Light and particle interactions
- `collisions/` – Kinetic and elastic interactions
- `deformation/` – Pressure, denting, and strain
- `reactions/` – Chemical, thermal, and molecular transformation

> *"Interaction is causality in action. The world changes when forces meet."*
