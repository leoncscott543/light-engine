--- keeping track of some initial procedural tasks setting up dev env for core light engine ---- 

- downloaded git
- created new light engine repository
- flushed out a rough draft of the engine directory tree structure
- made some generalist readme's, license, consistituion .mds.... will refine as I proceed 
- will develop on windows for the time being, at least setting up dev env.... 
- will migrate to linux, debian probably, once i begin low level development

- VS code as editor right now
- developed the core stack... will place it in this directory

RUST:
downloaded and installed rust standard tooling
  C:\Users\leonc\.rustup
  C:\Users\leonc\.cargo
  C:\Users\leonc\.cargo\bin
  
modifying the HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment/PATH registry key


Windows SubSystem for Linux dev Setup:

- installed WSL -windows subsystem for linux - in windows 11....
