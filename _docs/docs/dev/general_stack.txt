   - Extensible for plugins and custom commands

4. Realtime Preview Layer
   - Unified preview system for all dev layers (low, mid, high)
   - CLI-integrated and GUI-capable (using egui or similar, open source)
   - Live code reload and hot module replacement

5. Advanced Monitoring & Logging
   - Realtime performance monitoring (CPU, GPU, memory, IO, etc.)
   - Integrated logging and tracing (using tracing crate)
   - Custom dashboards for metrics and logs

6. Testing & QA
   - Built-in test framework (Rust native)
   - CLI commands for running, generating, and managing unlimited tests
   - Criterion for benchmarking
   - Automated test discovery and reporting

7. Rendering & Graphics
   - wgpu (Rust-native, cross-platform, open source)
   - No proprietary or closed-source graphics dependencies

8. Windowing & Input
   - winit (cross-platform, open source)
   - raw-window-handle (open source)

9. Math & Utilities
   - glam (SIMD math, open source)
   - rand, log, tracing (all open source)

10. Asset Management
    - image, gltf, tobj, serde, ron (all open source)
    - All asset pipelines in Rust

11. Audio
    - rodio, cpal (open source, Rust only)

12. Scripting & DSL
    - aria (custom DSL, open source, Rust implementation)
    - No external scripting engines

13. ECS & Physics
    - Custom ECS and physics engine (from scratch, open source, Rust only)

14. WebAssembly (WASM) Support
    - wasm-bindgen, wasm-pack, trunk (open source)
    - web-sys, js-sys (open source)

15. Containerization & Bootstrapping
    - Docker (for reproducible builds, CI, and deployment)
    - CLI bootstrapping: system detection, auto-download/install of dependencies and SDKs
    - DevContainers for VS Code (optional, open source)

16. Cloud & Edge Compatibility
    - Open source cloud SDKs (e.g., AWS SDK for Rust, Azure SDK for Rust, GCP SDK for Rust)
    - Edge compute node support (cross-compilation, simulation, deployment)
    - Multiplayer and distributed runtime support (tokio, quinn, open source networking)

17. AI & Data (DARA: Light Engineâ€™s Mind)
    - Custom AI/data engine (DARA), open source, Rust implementation
    - Integration with open source ML/data crates (tch-rs, burn, ndarray, polars, etc.)
    - Model training, simulation, and inference support
    - Cloud and edge deployment compatibility

18. Documentation
    - rustdoc, mdBook (open source)
    - CLI and GUI documentation generation

19. Project Management
    - Git (open source)
    - GitHub or any open source git hosting
    - All project management tools and workflows are open source

20. Philosophy & Architecture
    - 100% open source stack, no proprietary dependencies
    - Ultra cross-platform: Windows, Linux, macOS, WebAssembly, cloud, edge, future mobile/console
    - Modular, plug-and-play architecture at all levels
    - Designed for both developers and end-users (gamers, enthusiasts)
    - First-principles, close-to-metal, flexible, and nimble

This stack ensures maximum openness, flexibility, and cross-platform compatibility, with a focus on developer and user empowerment at every layer.
