# ðŸ§± matter/

The fundamental building blocks of the universe.  
This folder defines **everything that exists** in the simulation â€” from individual particles to complex environments.

### Structure:
- `particles/` â€“ Atomic and subatomic elements
- `materials/` â€“ Bonded particle collections (iron, flesh, fog)
- `things/` â€“ Objects composed of materials (trees, tools, bones)
- `environments/` â€“ Atmospheric or vacuum-like spaces

> *"Matter is the canvas of creation. Everything that is simulated starts here."*
