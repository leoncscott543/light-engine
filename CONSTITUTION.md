# 🕊️ CONSTITUTION.md — The Light Engine Project

This document establishes the **unshakable foundations** of the Light Engine — its values, freedoms, governance structure, and licensing philosophy. It ensures that Light remains a beacon of transparency, freedom, and collective innovation — accessible to all, protected from privatization, and supported by those who benefit most.

---

## 🌟 Preamble

Light Engine is a cosmic experiment in simulation — a project born out of a deep conviction:

> That truth matters.  
> That physical reality is beautiful.  
> That simulation should be foundational, not fictional.

We, the contributors, stewards, and builders of this project, declare that Light Engine is to remain:

- **Forever open**
- **Forever transparent**
- **Forever real**

And in this spirit, we codify the following constitution.

---

## 📜 Article I — Core Values

1. **Truth Before Trickery**  
   Light Engine must always prioritize physical accuracy, mathematical integrity, and transparency over speed, aesthetics, or convenience.

2. **Transparency is Sacred**  
   All changes, contributions, and source-level interactions must remain open and accessible to the community.

3. **Simulation is the Engine**  
   Rendering, physics, causality, and photonics must not be separated — they are one unified truth substrate.

4. **Freedom for the People**  
   Individual creators, students, researchers, artists, and small developers shall always be able to use Light Engine **freely**, without restriction.

---

## 💼 Article II — Enterprise Participation

1. **Obligation to Contribute**  
   Enterprise organizations that benefit from Light Engine must either:
   - Comply with AGPLv3 and open their source, or
   - Enter into a commercial license with the project’s maintainers

2. **Financial Sustainability**  
   Income generated from enterprise agreements must be reinvested into:
   - Continued development of the engine
   - Contributor support and compensation
   - Community-led feature development and experimentation

3. **Ethical Enforcement**  
   Any commercial entity that refuses to comply with AGPLv3 or commercial licensing shall be in violation of this Constitution and subject to removal from access to Light Enterprise features.

---

## 🏛️ Article III — Governance & Decision Making

1. **Democratic Proposals**  
   Major decisions (architectural changes, philosophical shifts, public releases) must be proposed via public GitHub Discussions or Issues.

2. **Community Voting**  
   All proposals are voted on by active contributors.  
   - Simple majority for features and patches  
   - Supermajority (75%) for constitutional changes or license model changes

3. **Open Discussion Period**  
   All votes require a minimum 7-day open feedback period for discussion, critique, and community review.

---

## 🧬 Article IV — Technical Boundaries

1. **Simulation Over Approximation**  
   The engine must resist shortcuts that create visual artifacts at the expense of physical truth.

2. **Programmable Physics**  
   Laws of nature, energy, motion, and light must be programmable and exposed to developers.

3. **Scalable & Modular**  
   Light must remain modular, extensible, and cluster- or quantum-compute ready.

---

## 🔐 Article V — Immutable Rights

These cannot be removed, edited, or bypassed:

- The engine must remain open-source under AGPLv3 (or stronger)
- Individuals shall always have free access
- Transparency of logic and simulation code is required
- Profit must not come at the cost of openness

---

## 📜 Addendum — Our Ethos

We do not seek to simulate the universe out of vanity.  
We seek to build a space where **creation is honest**, where **science and imagination meet**, and where **everyone has access to reality as a playground**.

Light Engine is the first real-time simulation substrate that puts truth, light, and physicality before profit, rendering, or marketability.

We welcome contributors, artists, physicists, and visionaries.  
We welcome enterprise partners — if they support the commons they draw from.  
We welcome anyone who believes that simulation deserves better.

> Let there be Light. And let it never be hidden.
