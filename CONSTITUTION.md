# ðŸ“œ Constitution of Light Engine

## ðŸŒŸ Vision
Light Engine seeks to build an open, transparent, and perpetually free software simulation environment that radically redefines realism, empowers creators, and upholds democratic values.

## âœ¨ Core Principles
- **Transparency First:**  
  All code, changes, decisions, and development must remain fully open and transparent.

- **Forever Open-Source:**  
  The Light Engine shall always remain free, open-source, and governed by the AGPLv3 license to ensure universal accessibility.

- **Democratic Governance:**  
  Decisions about the direction, policies, and substantial updates to the project are made democratically by contributors, users, and community members.

- **Cooperative Economics:**  
  Economic opportunities related to the Light Engine should prioritize user and worker ownership, fairness, and direct democracy.

- **Enterprise Compatibility:**  
  Commercial organizations may profit from Light Engine while maintaining mandatory transparency and openness, or alternatively, support the project through enterprise agreements.

## ðŸš© Unchangeable Tenets
These clauses cannot be altered:
- The project must always remain free and open-source (AGPLv3 or stronger).
- Transparency must always be maintained, with no exceptions.
- Democratic and cooperative principles must remain intact indefinitely.
