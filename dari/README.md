# AI Integration for Simulation Intelligence

This directory contains scaffolding for future AI-powered systems that support simulation optimization, interaction prediction, and dynamic system balancing.

## Purpose

AI is not at the core of Light Engine’s simulation — but it plays a critical role in:

- Real-time fidelity optimization
- Scene-aware heuristics (e.g., boosting detail near the camera)
- Predictive modeling and training-based tuning

## Structure

- `optimizers/`: Algorithms that tune fidelity and simulation parameters to meet developer goals (e.g., FPS, realism, memory constraints)
- `heuristics/`: Models that observe simulation state and adjust focus or resolution based on scene context

## Design Philosophy

AI is a **supporting intelligence** — not the simulation engine itself. It helps close the loop where computational limits prevent full Tier 3 fidelity in real time.

## Future Possibilities

- Reinforcement learning-based sim tuning
- Fidelity prediction based on scene class
- Adaptive resource reallocation across simulation subsystems
