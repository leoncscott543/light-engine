# ðŸ§  ordinem/

The orchestrating mind of the Light Engine.  
This module governs **time, causality, constants, and all physical laws** that guide how matter behaves and interacts. We are building the intangible natures of physical reality. 

### Contents:
- `laws/` â€“ Physics, chemistry, and energy rules
- `constants/` â€“ Fundamental universal constants
- `scheduler.rs` â€“ Manages simulation time and sequencing
- `integrator.rs` â€“ Handles continuous behavior over times
- `dsl/` â€“ Domain-specific language for defining custom scenes and behavior

> *"Ordinem is where law meets logic. This is the creator rulebook of the engine."*
