# ⚙️ 0_ordinem — The Order of Things

Welcome to the most sacred layer of the Light Engine.

This module is not about what you see. It’s not about models, assets, or particles.  
It’s about what you **feel**, what you **measure**, what governs how **everything behaves** — whether visible or not.

This is **Ordinem** — Latin for *“order”*.  
Here we define the core laws, constants, and principles that bind the universe together.

## 🧭 Purpose

Ordinem is the invisible framework that holds reality together in simulation:

- **Time** — not just ticks or frames, but causal delta across interactions.
- **Energy** — tracked, conserved, transferred, absorbed, emitted.
- **Causality** — chain reactions, event sourcing, and propagation through time.
- **Laws** — modular, extensible definitions of the physical and photonic world.
- **Constants** — foundational numerical truths that anchor our equations.

This folder is the **bedrock** of all simulation in Light Engine.

## 🕰️ Time

Time in Light is not just a number. It’s a system of change.

- Simulation ticks represent causally governed deltas — not FPS frames.
- Objects exist across snapshots of time.
- Reversible simulation is possible when time is respected, not faked.
- Nested time scales will eventually support atomic timing, geologic timing, and speculative future timing.

---

## 🔥 Energy

Energy is tracked like a currency:

- Stored, transferred, transformed
- Bound to particles and materials
- Needed to create, move, heat, or fracture

You do not “animate” fire in Light Engine.  
You **ignite** it — and it must have **fuel**, **oxygen**, **space**, and **energy**.

---

## 🔁 Causality

One of Light’s core design rules is that **everything must happen for a reason**.

- Particle A hits Particle B → deformation → photon emission
- Light strikes translucent matter → heat → internal state change
- Water freezes → expands → exerts pressure on nearby material

Causality chains must be traceable.  
This is vital for integrity, training AI models, and future debugging of large-scale simulations.

---

## 📏 Constants

All real-world simulation begins with known truths:

- Speed of light
- Planck’s constant
- Avogadro’s number
- Gravitational constant
- Thermal conductivity of copper

Constants here are **structured**, **documented**, and **sourced**.  
They’re used to feed laws and resolve equations when only a few inputs are known.

---

## ⚖️ Laws

Laws in `0_ordinem/laws/` are the heart of deterministic simulation.

Each law module includes:
- Inputs and knowns
- Resolution rules
- Conditions for solvability
- Reference to constants
- Output variable estimators

We treat **laws as logic contracts**.  
They are modular and can be reasoned about mathematically.  
Each law is eventually callable from the particle simulation layer — enabling both real-time and learned approximations.

---

## 🔬 Why This Matters

Without Ordinem, there is no simulation — only performance art.

Ordinem ensures that:
- No effect exists without a cause
- No transformation violates conservation
- No shortcut is ever silently accepted

This folder is where we draw the line.  
Reality is programmable — but only if we respect the rules.

---

## 🧠 Future Vision

As Light Engine grows, `0_ordinem/` will eventually power:

- Cluster-scale environmental simulations
- Time-step debuggers and visualizers
- Physics-aware AI surrogate model training
- Energy-aware simulation limits
- Temporal lensing (slow time, fast time, nested timelines)

Ordinem is the **spine of Light**.  
You may never render it, but every atom and photon obeys it.

---

## 🧬 Contributing to Ordinem

- Follow the structure for constants, laws, and propagation models
- Document all source equations
- Ensure units and dimensionality are validated
- Write test cases and lab experiments when adding new physical logic

---

## 🌌 Final Words

Ordinem is the one part of Light Engine that must never lie.  
It is where we define not just what things look like — but what they *are*, and how they *become*.

Here, **reality is written.**

And what you write here… governs everything else.

Let there be Light. Let there be Order.
