# BEAM: Bounded Emulation of Atomic Model

This module contains all logic and structure related to exporting Light Engine scenes and assets to external or legacy platforms.

## Purpose

BEAM acts as a translation layer that projects Light Engine’s physically-simulated scenes into a constrained format compatible with traditional rendering and design pipelines (e.g., Unity, Unreal, Blender). 

The goal is to retain as much physical and interaction data as possible, even when fidelity is compressed or downgraded.

## Structure

- `exporters/`: Core logic for converting Light Engine scenes to BEAM format
- `schemas/`: File format definitions and data contracts for BEAM containers
- `plugins/`: Interface modules or scripts to enable importing BEAM files into legacy platforms

## Status

This system is scaffolded and evolving. Current focus is on defining data flow, structuring the export manifest, and building reference plugins.

## Design Goal

BEAM is not a lossy export for convenience — it is a **projection of Light Engine’s simulation** into a bounded container with embedded intelligence.
